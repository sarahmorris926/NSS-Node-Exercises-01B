# NSS-Node-Exercises-01B
NSS Node.JS Exercises: 01B - Compose/Aggregate

## Requirements

For this exercise you will create another Hello World program. However, unlike
the last exercise, this program must be able to be executed directly by the
operating system.

Create a JavaScript file to act as a Node.js program named `direct-exec.js`. The file
should contain JavaScript code to output the phrase "Hello, World. I was executed without the 'node' command!" to the terminal through the stdout stream.

Expected:

```bash
$ ./direct-exec.js
Hello, World. I was executed without the 'node' command!
```
